# Is Covid-19 Data Tampered?
Are COVID-19 numbers reported by countries altered? I test the validity of COVID-19 new daily cases for every country using Benford's Law.

Please read my post for the results of analysis. This repository contans scripts for calculating and creating the figures. It also has the codes for the R Shiny app created.
